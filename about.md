Awhile back I studied pure mathematics and chemical engineering at University
of Calgary. Realizing that I need programming to bridge the gap between
mathematical theorems and chemical engineering applications, I taught myself
that as well.


Now days I am working as a research engineer, looking at how math and
programming can be leveraged to solve interesting engineering problems. This
blog is an attempt to capture some of the things I learned along the way.
